MVP:
	Add link to API
	Search Bar
	Returns single, or list of Jokes relevant to searched word
	Looks decent enough (laugh with, not at)

PMVP:
	Cross reference? Intersection jokes (Fat + Dentist, Mother in Law + Mean) <- all will be SFW, easier to plan this out 

Goals: 

	Days Prior - Have API picked out, beginning to code Get function
	M - have basic framework in development
	T initial model
	W mvp working 
	Th post mvp
	F: present
